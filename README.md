# Fiber Photometry Data Analysis for Ucn

## Introduction
This repository contains the analysis pipeline for fiber photometry experiments conducted to monitor the activity of Urocortin-expressing Edinger Westphal neurons in vivo. 
The code includes two parts:  
   - Z score analysis
   - Area under curve calculation

## File Structure
The dataset is stored in a tdt system generated file format
- Get it with a dropbox link: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/j7iapyj3py4270dp5hp26/h?rlkey=iacwu25nmztyd709aomkzg564&st=9x2lwe5k&dl=0

## Requirements

- Tdt 
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- os
- Statistics

Ensure these are installed by running:
```bash
